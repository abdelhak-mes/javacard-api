/**
 * This abstract class defines an Java Card technology-based applet.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Applet</code> class must be extended by any applet that is
 * intended to be loaded onto, installed into and executed on a Java Card
 * technology-compliant smart card.
 * <p>
 * A compliant Java Card platform may optionally support the ISO7816-4 defined
 * extended length APDU protocol. The applet subclass must implement the
 * <code>javacardx.apdu.ExtendedLength</code> interface to access this
 * extended length APDU protocol capability of the
 * <code>javacard.framework.APDU</code> object.

  /**
   * To create an instance of the <code>Applet</code> subclass, the Java
   * Card runtime environment will call this static method first.
   * <p>
   * The applet should perform any necessary initializations and must call one
   * of the <code>register()</code> methods. Only one Applet instance can be
   * successfully registered from within this install. The installation is
   * considered successful when the call to <code>register()</code>
   * completes without an exception. The installation is deemed unsuccessful
   * if the <code>install</code> method does not call a
   * <code>register()</code> method, or if an exception is thrown from
   * within the <code>install</code> method prior to the call to a
   * <code>register()</code> method, or if every call to the
   * <code>register()</code> method results in an exception. If the
   * installation is unsuccessful, the Java Card runtime environment must
   * perform all the necessary clean up when it receives control. Successful
   * installation makes the applet instance capable of being selected via a
   * SELECT APDU command.
   * <p>
   * Installation parameters are supplied in the byte array parameter and must
   * be in a format using length-value (LV) pairs as defined below:
   *
   * <pre>
   * bArray[bOffset] = length(Li) of instance AID, bArray[bOffset+1..bOffset+Li]
   * = instance AID bytes, bArray[bOffset+Li+1]= length(Lc) of control info,
   * bArray[bOffset+Li+2..bOffset+Li+Lc+1] = control info,
   * bArray[bOffset+Li+Lc+2] = length(La) of applet data,
   * bArray[bOffset+Li+Lc+3..bOffset+Li+Lc+La+2] = applet data
   * </pre>
   *
   * In the above format, any of the lengths: Li, Lc or La may be zero. The
   * control information is implementation dependent.
   * <p>
   * The <code>bArray</code> object is a global array. If the applet desires
   * to preserve any of this data, it should copy the data into its own
   * object.
   * <p>
   * <code>bArray</code> is zeroed by the Java Card runtime environment
   * after the return from the <code>install()</code> method.
   * <p>
   * References to the <code>bArray</code> object cannot be stored in class
   * variables or instance variables or array components. See
   * <em>Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card Platform, Classic
   * Edition</em>, section 6.2.2 for details. <p> The implementation of this
   * method provided by <code>Applet</code> class throws an
   * <code>ISOException</code> with reason code =
   * <code>ISO7816.SW_FUNC_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>.
   * <p>
